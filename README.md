# Live Your Most Bee Live Now!
Welcome to the Wiki For NotTheBee.com Here you'll find a rundown of how to use the site!

## The Basics:
Look at the top of the page. See that bar going across the top with some words and buttons? That is where you'll find the major parts and features of NtB: News Articles, Social, Groups, Profiles, a Shop, Search, Notifications, and the Content Menu.

## News Articles:
This is the public face of Not the Bee. Here you will find articles written by supremely witty authors about *real* new that just seems like it aught to be a [Babylon Bee](https://www.babylonbee.com) article.

## Social:
On the Social tab of NtB you'll find posts from other members of NtB! You're welcome to post as well, but, please do try to keep it family friendly. If you've got an awesome meme with some naughty words. Maybe blur them out first and cover them with [\[Flowerbed\]](flowerbed). If you're posting a video, please be sure to give a Flowerbed warning

## Groups
Groups on NtB allow you to have a space to talk about topics. We've got all kinds of groups so far: Book Clubs, Theology, Tolkien Book Clubs (yes, multiple), C.S. Lewis Book Clubs (yes, multiple), Coding, Memes, Dad Jokes, Video Games, Economics, Podcasts Finances... You name it, we got it. If we don't, then maybe you can start one!

## Profiles
Aight, you probably already realized it when you were signing up but, yes *YOU* get a profile <insert Oprah gif>. There's a description of yourself with the funny name that you change every 31.4159 hours, a list of all the glorious groups you've joined, your past posts/comments/mentions, and the groups that you've created!
  
## Search
Do I *really* need to spell this out? Type some thing in there and it'll seach for articles or users that match

## Notifications
K, this should be pretty obvious like everything else so far on this suuuper quick overview. Is a bell icon. If you see a red dot, it means you have a notification! Hooray! Read here for more info about how the Notification system works, and how you can use it to filter through the fluff to get some real meat 'n taters. <insert gollum GIF>
  
## Content Menu
Here's where you can get to some less obvious things with NtB, like changing your user settings. The first few item's we've already covered briefly. But there's a few more:

### Home:
Uh, this is kinda just a defunct set of links. The only thing here you won't find super quick else where is the "Who to Follow" link, which just lists a few recent articles, The most popular groups and a list of important people on NtB, [Disrn](https://www.disrn.com) and the [Babylon Bee](https://www.babylonbee.com).

### Invite Guests
Huh? Guests? Yeah, so guess what, you can invite upto two people to join you on Not the Bee! C'mon man, share your friends with us too!  Oh, and maybe you've already noticed a number on some user's avatars? That's their [Community Score](Broken LINK). For each 1 million points <insert dr Evil GIF> you get to invite another user to Not The Bee! Isn't that awesome? And all of these guests get free access for as long as *you* stay subscribed! No silly "trial" gimmicks here!
  
### Friends
Friends are kinda a new feature on NtB. You can *Follow* anyone, but people gotta accept your request to be a friend. Keep in mind that anyone can see your profile, but friends can see a bit *more* about you like where you went to school. You don't have to put that info in, but hey whatevs. Just don't go friending *everyone* who likes your comment. We do that a lot. I'm certainly not gonna accept a friend request from some stranger that just joined NtB 15 minutes ago like you did.

### Saved Posts
User Posts have a paperclip icon button that you can click. <insert screenshot> This saves the post so that you can find it quickly here later! That's it!

### My Activity
Pretty self explanatory

### Favorites
It's just like Saved Posts, but for Articles .... Man, some of these are *GOLD*

### Settings
Aha! in case you were wondering how to share all the little details of your life in once convenient location, this is it! Click here to Read more!<Create Page explaining the settings and link it here>
